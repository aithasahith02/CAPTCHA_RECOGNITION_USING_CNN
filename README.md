# CAPTCHA_RECOGNITION_USING_CNN
A Deep Learning model which recognizes a Four Charactered CAPTCHA
Completely Automated Public Turing Test to Tell Computers and Humans Apart (CAPTCHA) is an important human-machine distinction technology for website to prevent the automatic malicious program attack. CAPTCHA recognition studies can find security breaches in CAPTCHA, improve CAPTCHA technology, it can also promote the technologies of license plate recognition and handwriting recognition . However using the concept of deep learning and computer vision, the very purpose of the CAPTCHAs can be defeated. This test can be passed automatically with the help of Convolutional Neural networks(CNN). A CNN is an algorithm o deep learning which takes an image as input and then assigns some value to various features in the image which further helps to differentiate one feature from the other. Itâ€™s main purpose is to transform the images into a form which is much easier to process, without losing features which are essential for getting an optimized prediction. The future scope of this work lies to expand this CAPTCHA recognition system for larger and more noisy CAPTCHA containing all the symbols possible.
Tensorboad is used to evaluate and visualize the model training and performance.The model achieved an accuracy of (70-80)%.
